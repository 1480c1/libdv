This is LibDV, a GPL codec for DV video.  

See http://libdv.sourceforge.net/

LibDV now uses the GNU "Autotools" for building.  

BUILDING from CVS checkout
==========================

The CVS repository does not contain files generated by the autotools,
so you need to run the bootstrap script*:

  ./bootstrap

You can ignore the following error messages:

  automake: configure.in: installing `config/install-sh'
      error while copying

  automake: configure.in: installing `config/mkinstalldirs'
      error while copying

  automake: configure.in: installing `config/missing'
      error while copying


After that, you can do this to build the library and the example
player:

  ./configure --enable-maintainer-mode
  make

The maintainer-mode is if you are on a system that has recent
autotools installed, and you wish to make changes to the build
scripts.


* The autotools book (http://sources.redhat.com/autobook/) recommends
  "bootstrap" instead of autogen.sh.
