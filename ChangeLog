	* NTSC encoding fixups.

2001-03-05  Peter Schlaile <udbz@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>
	
	* Encoder speedups (factor 3 from realtime on my machine, it even
	  beats playdv using gtk display ;-) )

	* Fixed stupid need_dct_248() bug

	* Correct(tm) and faster quantization 

2001-02-14  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Version 0.5

	* Integrate patch #103780 "encoder and ppmqscale improvements",
	  from Peter Schlaile (see below)

	* Bump libtool library version number to reflect dv_init()
	  interface change.

	* Bug fix for bug #131581: 
	  "Initializating multiple dv_decoder_t	objects fails".  

	  Changed dv_init() to remove dependence on per-stream object, and
	  ignore multiple invocations.

	* Bugfix from Stefan Lucke for recent PAL breakage.

	* Cleaner rpm rule in Makefile.am

2001-02-14  Peter Schlaile <udbz@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * Again encoder speedups.
	
	* Fixed serious quant bugs (divide != shift!!!!)
	
	* Implemented DCT248 AAN version in C and MMX
	
	* Integrated use of DCT248 (somewhat experimental. My camcorder
	  apparently uses motion detection for this one...)
	
	* General code cleanups
	
	* ppmqscale can now shrink pictures
	
	* Added a lot of FIXMEs so other people can also improve things
	  (hint, hint ;-)
	
2001-02-08  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Add --enable-gprof to configure.  Disable SDL by default.  Minor
	  fixups in display.c for missing #if HAVE_GTK and #if HAVE_SDL.

2001-02-07  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Version 0.4.

	* Cosmetic nit:  move to consistent use of C style comments.

	* Integrate patch from Scott F. Johnston for non-gcc non-x86
	  architectures.  Add untested fixed_multiply to idct_248.c for
	  non-gcc non-x86 architectures.  Also disable popt on non-gcc,
	  since our popt code uses gcc struct initialization extension
	  heavily.

	* Integrate patch from Stefan Lucke for aspect-ratio handling
	  with Xv based display.

2001-02-06  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Integrate patch from Stefan Lucke for various speedups:

           - replace pointer dereferences with indexed accesses.

           - merge 248 idct prescale into 248 quant.

           - change IEC PAL (420) to generate YUY2 instead of YV12.  

	     Is this really faster?  If so, I am suprised.  I have added a
	     configure option to allow choosing which version to build
	     (YUY2 is default), so I can verify the performance comparison.

	   - Fix to Makefile.vanilla to include util.c in build.

	   - still to do: it looks like there are incompatable versions of
	     popt around.  Need to add a configure check to figure out
	     whether filename needs to be declared as a const char *.

	* Change license banner to read "a free DV codec" instead of "a
	  free decoder".

	* Add the banner to files that didn't have it.

2001-02-03  Peter Schlaile <udbz@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>

        * Additional encoder speedups and improvements it now also uses
	  popt, can read ppm-streams, can correct wrongly interlaced input
	  pictures.  Speedups: we are between 4 and 5 times away from
	  realtime on my AMD K6/400 ;-) slowest part is now the RGB to YUV
	  conversion.	
	
	* added new program
	  - ppmqscale           quality (and quick) ppm scaler.Use it like this
	                        cat *.ppm |ppmqscale 720 576 |encode -- -
	                        does linear interpolation, next thing is
				MMX optimization for it.
	
	* playdv can now write ppm-streams  
	  
2001-01-20  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* version 0.3

	* Minor configure.in cleanups.

	* Add Peter's new utilities to Makefile.am.  Minor cleanups for
	  -Wall.
	

2001-01-20  Peter Schlaile <udbz@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>
	
	* Made encoder finally work correctly for DCT 88
	  Inserted META information
	
	* Added playdv option: dump frames
	
	* added new programs: 
	  - insert_audio        Audio dub an existing video stream
	                        or just copy audio data to DV using 
	                        insert_audio [wav_file] <<EOF |dvsend
	                        EOF
	  - fix_headers         Fix old encoded dv files without 
	                        meta information
	  - scan_packet_headers Dump dv files in a nice way. 
	                        (Take a look how badly encode 
	                        still performs... )
	  - steal_headers       Copy meta headers from a captured stream for
	                        testing.
	
2001-01-18  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Create a rpm .spec.in file.  configure generates the .spec.
	  Makefile.am has a rpm target.  Update the README.  Add a debug
	  option to configure to control "-g" in CFLAGS.

2001-01-16  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Add alternate definitions of bitfield structs for architectures
	  with big-endian bitfields.

	* Add AC_C_BIGENDIAN to configure.in.

	* Makefile.am tweeks: Add ac_c_bigendian_cross.m4 to
	  AUX_DIST_EXTRA; eliminate duplicate references to header files.

	* Move bitstream_t to dv_types.h.  Remove a few #include
	  "bitstream.h"'s as a result.

	* Make definition swab32() conditional on WORDS_BIGENDIAN.

	* New autoconf macro for testing endianness.  The stock autoconf
	  test doesn't work with cross-compiling, and autoconf generates a
	  warning to that effect.


2001-01-14  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Add bgr0 support for kino submitted by Arne Schirmacher
	  <arne@schirmacher.de>.

	* Add command line option interface to playdv, using popt.

	* Add more audio code structure; pre-emphasis, speed detection
	  (only play normal speed audio).

	* Header file re-structuring.  Move types to new dv_types.h;
	  enclose declarations in extern "C" for C++ compatibility;
	  replace leading '_' from preprocessor symbols with 'DV_'
	  prefix.  

	* Add exit() handler to avoid Sys V shmem leak with Xv.  (Still
	  have to do SDL, and gtk).

	* Add _GNU_SOURCE define, enabling large (>2GB) file support.
	
2001-01-08  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Add preliminary support for audio.  New files are audio.[ch]
	  which does the unshuffling, and oss.[ch] which is provides an
	  example of playout via the OSS sound API.
 
2000-12-27  Peter Schlaile <udbz@rz.uni-karlsruhe.de>
	* Integrated MMX/ASM-optimizations into the encoder. 
	  (YUV, DCT88, quant)
	  The YUV conversion is 2 bits more accurate than before, the DCT
	  is somewhat less accurate (approximately 1 or 2 bits) so it
	  should be more or less the same as the old C code. Best thing:
	  it is 8 times faster now!
	
2000-12-21  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Applied outstanding patch submissions.  The major parts included
	getting the encoder to build again, and autotool'ing the build.
	This ChangeLog files is far from complete.  The log
	information in CVS is where most of the changes are documented.
 
2000-05-08  Charlie Krasic  <krasic@cse.ogi.edu>

	* Moved to macroblock at a time color conversion, based on the work
 	  of Scott F. Johnston <scott@fleetingimage.com>.  I rewrote his
 	  shuffle code.  Partly so I could understand it better (I added
 	  lots of comments), and also I did the PAL version too.  I decided
 	  to leave mapping between dif blocks/segments and superblock
 	  row/columns to the parse code.  I took his block at a time ycrcb
 	  conversion directly, except for making clamp_y lookup based.

2000-05-05  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* New idct code for 2-4-8.  It's an integer version, based on an
 	approach like that of the AAN algorithm.  Next step will be to MMX
 	it.

2000-04-20  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* place.c: Fixes to 4:2:0 placement.  Color resembles something
 	like correct now. :}

	* Add initial macroblock placement for 4:2:0 (IEC61834).  Initial
 	  test shows luma is OK, but color isn't working correctly.
 
2000-04-19  Erik Walthinnsen (Omega)  <omega@cse.ogi.edu>

	* Added rudimentary PAL decoding, as well as a way to
 	  differentiate between IEC61834 and SMPTE314M video, which is
 	  critical for dealing with PAL data.

2000-04-18  Charles 'Buck' Krasic  <krasic@acm.org>

	* Version 0.1 - first release at libdv.sourceforge.net
