	* Integrated MMX/ASM-optimizations into the encoder. 
	  (YUV, DCT88, quant)
	  The YUV conversion is 2 bits more accurate than before, the DCT
	  is somewhat less accurate (approximately 1 or 2 bits) so it
	  should be more or less the same as the old C code. Best thing:
	  it is 8 times faster now!

	* Applied outstanding patch submissions.  The major parts included
	getting the encoder to build again, and autotool'ing the build.
	This ChangeLog files is far from complete.  The log
	information in CVS is where most of the changes are documented.

	* Moved to macroblock at a time color conversion, based on the work
 	  of Scott F. Johnston <scott@fleetingimage.com>.  I rewrote his
 	  shuffle code.  Partly so I could understand it better (I added
 	  lots of comments), and also I did the PAL version too.  I decided
 	  to leave mapping between dif blocks/segments and superblock
 	  row/columns to the parse code.  I took his block at a time ycrcb
 	  conversion directly, except for making clamp_y lookup based.

	* New idct code for 2-4-8.  It's an integer version, based on an
 	approach like that of the AAN algorithm.  Next step will be to MMX
 	it.

	* place.c: Fixes to 4:2:0 placement.  Color resembles something
 	like correct now. :}

	* Add initial macroblock placement for 4:2:0 (IEC61834).  Initial
 	  test shows luma is OK, but color isn't working correctly.
 
2000-04-19  Erik Walthinnsen (Omega)  <omega@cse.ogi.edu>

	* Added rudimentary PAL decoding, as well as a way to
 	  differentiate between IEC61834 and SMPTE314M video, which is
 	  critical for dealing with PAL data.

	* Version 0.1 - first release at libdv.sourceforge.net
